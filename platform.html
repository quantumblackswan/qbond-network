      <h2>How the Platform Works</h2>
      <p>
        Q‑BOND Network blends decentralized science funding, validator
        governance and yield‑generating NFTs tied to real‑world research.
        Users stake capital or computational resources into Q‑BONDs, which are
        algorithmically assigned to research proposals across quantum
        computing, biotech, energy and other high‑impact sectors. Yield is
        calculated by AI models based on project progress and market demand
        and distributed to bond holders through smart contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The network also mints sovereign identity tokens (QIE) for each
        participant, enabling private yet verifiable participation. XP‑based
        bonding curves incentivize long‑term engagement, while cross‑chain
        staking allows users to move effortlessly between Ethereum, QANX and
        other ecosystems.
      </p>

      <h2>Business Model</h2>
      <p>
        Q‑BOND Network generates revenue through multiple streams: validator
        staking fees, yield‑based scientific bond purchases and enterprise
        subscriptions for AI‑enhanced research tools. The platform also
        licenses its technology to banks and sovereign funds and collects a
        percentage of capital staked in the network.

      <h2>Primary Service</h2>
      <p>
        At its core Q‑BOND is an AI‑powered bond protocol allowing anyone to
        invest in emerging science through tokenized bonds. These bonds
        offer yield, gamification and secondary market liquidity, providing
        a seamless investment experience.

      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        The project is pursuing a phased mainnet rollout starting in Q3. Early
        phases will focus on validator onboarding and the launch of our
        Codex NFT protocol. We are actively exploring collaborations with
        networks like Starknet to leverage zero‑knowledge scalability and
        composability.
