      <h2>Formation & Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Q‑BOND Network operates through DeSCI‑Q DAO LLC, a Wyoming
        decentralized autonomous organization limited liability company. The DAO
        coordinates governance of the open‑source Q‑BOND protocol, which
        supports scientific research through community‑led scoring and
        digital collectible issuance. Importantly, the DAO does
        not issue financial instruments or investment products and has no
        centralized management.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Legal Framework</h2>
      <p>
        The DAO is a member‑managed organization governed by smart contracts
        deployed on multiple chains. The primary chain is QANX, with secondary
        deployments planned on Arbitrum and ZKSync. Governance
        relies entirely on autonomous software and community voting rather
        than human or corporate managers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Membership</h2>
      <p>
        Any individual who holds a QIE identity, participates in governance
        or interacts with the protocol is considered a member. There are no
        restrictions based on location, wallet size or status. Members
        may submit proposals, vote and contribute to scoring and protocol
        evolution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Liability & Risk</h2>
      <p>
        Members are not personally liable for the debts or obligations of the
        DAO. The DAO itself is not liable for loss of digital
        assets, smart contract bugs, project outcomes or governance
        decisions. Participation is entirely at the user’s own
        risk, reflecting the experimental nature of decentralized research and
        finance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Purpose Limitation</h2>
      <p>
        The DAO operates exclusively to support decentralized research scoring,
        fund scientific progress via digital collectibles and enable open,
        identity‑based contribution mechanisms. Q‑BONDs are not
        investments and do not entitle holders to profits, equity or
        guaranteed yield.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        Changes to this operating agreement may be proposed and passed by DAO
        vote. All amendments must be implemented through
        on‑chain governance and recorded in DAO records.
